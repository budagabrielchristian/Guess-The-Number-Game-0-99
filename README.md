In order to start playing the game, you must create an object of that class in your main class.

Example:
```
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		GuessTheNumber gtn = new GuessTheNumber();
	}
}
```
If it says "Too low!", it means that the number you have inputted is smaller than the number you must guess.
If it says "Too high!", it means that the number you have inputted is bigger than the number you must guess.

Have fun!!
